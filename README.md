# 🕵️‍♂️ Fraud Detection with Supervised Learning

Welcome to the Fraud Detection project! This repository shows how to create a basic fraud detection system using supervised learning. We’ll guide you through data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, all within Google Colab. The objective is to identify fraudulent transactions and enhance security.

## 🛠 Project Structure

- **data/**: This folder contains datasets used in the project.
- **notebooks/**: Google Colab notebooks with step-by-step instructions for data exploration, model training, and evaluation, all designed to run in Google Colab.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and making predictions.
- **models/**: Trained models and serialized files for reuse.
- **README.md**: This file!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- A Google account to use Google Colab.
- Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning.

### Setup

1. **Open the Notebook**: Clone this repository and open the `notebooks/` folder in Google Colab.
   
2. **Install Dependencies**: The first code cell in the notebook will install all necessary libraries. Just run the cell, and Colab will handle the rest!

3. **Upload the Data**: Upload the dataset to your Colab session or connect to a Google Drive folder containing your data.

4. **Run the Notebook**: Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train your model, and evaluate its performance.

## 📊 Data

The data used in this project is a collection of transaction records. Each transaction is labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate. The dataset typically includes features like transaction amount, time, and other relevant attributes.

## 🔍 Process Overview

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical features
   - Scaling numerical features
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets

2. **Model Training**:
   - Using popular algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests
   - Training the model with labeled data

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Fine-tuning the model for better performance

4. **Prediction**:
   - Using the trained model to predict the likelihood of fraud in new transactions

## 📈 Results

After running the notebook, you should have a trained model capable of detecting fraudulent transactions. Use the provided evaluation metrics to determine how well your model performs.
